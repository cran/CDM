CDM 2.3 (2013-09-06)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x worked on slight improvements of computation time in din
  and gdina
x included multiple group dataset 'data.mg'
x cleaned CDM manual (thanks to Michaela Mayr)


--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 2.2 (2013-08-20)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x accelerated rowMaxs function
x included Q-matrix validation function (de la Torre, 2008)
x included joint maximum likelihood estimation and
  classification function for the mixed DINA/DINO model
  -> function din.deterministic
x included another example (based on attribute vectors) 
  in sim.din function
x included polytomous GDINA model (Chen & de la Torre, 2013)  

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 2.01 (2013-07-27)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x fixed a bug in gdm in multiple group estimation: group
  labeling was incorrect and is now included in output group.stat
  and displayed in summary.gdm
x improved convergence behavior for multiple group analysis
x accelerated calculation in gdm: skillspace reduction

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.5 (2013-07-09)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x allowed for centering of intercepts and slopes in gdm
x included satured skill distribution estimation in gdm
x fixed a bug in the calculation of RMSEA itemfit, although
  is not clear if the correct formula is used
x fixed a bug in gdm with varying number of item categories
  (thanks to Artur Pokropek)
x included the multidimensional latent class IRT model 
  (Bartolucci, 2007) in gdm (skillspace="est")
x speeded calculation of modelfit.cor

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.4 (2013-06-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x eliminated a bug in GDINA function for link="log"
x included the parametrization of the reduced RUM model in gdina
x worked on higher order GDINA model which has the argument
  HOGDINA in gdina. Now there is dependency on the fa factor 
  analysis function in the psych package.
x included log-likelihood extractor functions
x included group-wise calculation of RMSEA statistics
  see itemfit.rmsea and the gdm output (thanks to Artur Pokropek)
x (hopefully) fixed a bug in gdm function with differing number of
  item categories (thanks to Artur Pokropek)  
x use frequency patterns in gdm to speed up calculations
  for large data sets (argument 'use.freqpatt' in gdm function)
x included more than one step in gdm function
  - arguments msteps (set to 8 M steps as the default) and
    convM

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.3 (2013-05-15)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x included the general diagnostic model (function gdm)
x included a function for calculating equivalent skill classes
  for the DINA/DINO model
x modelfit and anova functions are also accessible for the GDM
x fixed a bug in the function for classification accuracy
x included the RMSEA item fit index
x fixed a bug in gdina estimation
x included coef extractor function

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.2-3 (2013-02-12)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x included a model fit function modelfit.cor(.din) for the
  comparison of observed and expected correlations
x fixed a bug in the gdina function when applying the model
  with one skill

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.2-1/1.2-2 (2013-02-01)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x allow for user specified reduced skill space designs
x included tetrachoric correlations in summary.gdina function
x handled zero probability classes in gdina function
x allowed for output and input of attribute patterns in sim.din
  function
x included relative deviance change as convergence criterion in din
  function
x included function for determining a statistically equivalent 
  DINA model (von Davier, 2013)
x changed structure of din summary
x included an anova function
x included a function for estimating classification reliability
x fixed a bug in gdina function when creating design matrices

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.2.0 (2012-09-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x implemented the latent skill space reduction according
  to Xu and von Davier (2008)
x fixed a bug in calculation of estimated parameters
x fixed a bug in IDI calculation
x corrected MLE based classification in case of latent
  classes with a priori spceified zero probability in the
  din function (yet to be done in gdina)
x fixed a bug in standard error calculation in gdina
x speed improvements in din and gdina function
  - included a C function for calculating the posterior 
    distribution
x check of admissible rule in gdina
x include rule "GDINA2" and "GDINA1" ("GDINA1" is 
  equivalent to "ACDM")
x Simulation function for the GDINA model included
x multiple group gdina function for estimation of
  generalized DINA models (de la Torre, 2011)
x new function summary.gdina

--------------------------------------------------------------
CDM 1.1 (2012-07-29)
--------------------------------------------------------------

x highest argument deleted from print.din method
x new argument for summary.din n.skill.classes
x skill pattern probabilities deleted from print.din
x skill pattern summary replaced by n most frequent skill 
  classes in summary.din
x (argument ask=TRUE in summary.din placed by overwrite=FALSE)
x use a different item discrimination index (Lee et al., 2012)
x remove GDINA estimation from this package version because
  it is in an experimental status 
    -> gdina will be included in CDM >= 1.1-1
x new optional attribute for q-matrix specification list of skill 
  labels
